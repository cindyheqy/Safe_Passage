# Safe_Passage_Program-

The Chicago Public Schools Safe Passage program is offered to select schools to provide a positive, trusted adult presence for students as they travel to and from school. The objective of my project is to provide a comprehensive visual representation of the Safe Passages program in Chicago and its relationship with the socio-economic conditions of the surrounding areas, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and utilize the information.

Using the ggplot library in R, I created interactive plots and maps to illustrate the geographic locations of the Safe Passages program and their relationship with various demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as income levels and crime rates.

One of the findings of the project is that the Safe Passages program primarily operates in low-income regions. This plot serves as evidence of the correlation between the location of the Safe Passages program and the income levels of the surrounding areas. This information can be used to better understand the needs of the communities served by the Safe Passages program and to inform decision-making related to the allocation of resources.
